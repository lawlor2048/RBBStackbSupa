## The Hidden Costs of Unplanned Downtime

In today's manufacturing landscape, unplanned downtime represents one of the most significant operational challenges, with costs varying dramatically across industries. Our analysis reveals striking figures:

- **Automotive Manufacturing**: Up to €200,000 per hour
- **Consumer Goods Production**: Approximately €30,000 per hour
- **Food & Beverage**: €20,000 to €30,000 per hour

These figures align with global research from Activant Capital and other industry analysts, highlighting how complex production processes face exponentially higher costs from unexpected failures.

## Transforming Maintenance with IoT

Recent Deloitte research demonstrates the transformative impact of IoT-enabled predictive maintenance:

- **10-20% reduction** in overall maintenance costs
- **20-25% decrease** in unplanned downtime
- **5-10% increase** in production capacity

### Real-World Success: Armal's Energy Revolution

A compelling example comes from Armal, a leading manufacturer of portable sanitation solutions. Through implementing IoT-based real-time production monitoring:

- Achieved nearly **40% reduction** in energy costs
- Improved production line efficiency by **25%**
- ROI achieved within **8 months** of implementation
